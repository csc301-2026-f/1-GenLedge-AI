# Smoke Tests

## File validation (US2, no intake database)

- Action: Install backend development requirements and run `python -m pytest tests`
  from `src/backend`.
  Expected: Parser and upload API tests pass with no database. API tests use
  main's existing demo login session.
- Action: From `src/backend`, run `python -m app.sources.connectors.files <file>`.
  Expected: A valid file prints collection summaries with `persisted: false`;
  an invalid file exits nonzero with a validation message. No database is needed.
- Action: Sign into the connected frontend, click Upload File, select a CSV, then
  Validate File. Repeat with a multi-sheet XLSX and nested JSON/NDJSON.
  Expected: Counts and any header corrections appear. Success says nothing is
  saved and does not navigate to discovery or add a source row.
- Action: Try an empty file, unsupported extension, file larger than 25 MB,
  malformed table row, or a sheet with more than 50,000 data rows.
  Expected: An actionable error appears; no success summary remains. A corrected
  file can be selected and validated without closing the modal.
- Action: Stop Flask, try validation, restart Flask and sign in again if needed.
  Expected: Failure is shown, and retry is possible.
- Action: Sign out and call `/api/sources/uploads/csrf` or submit an upload.
  Expected: 401. After signing in, an upload missing a valid `X-CSRF-Token` returns
  403. A token from before logout cannot be reused after signing in again.
- Action: With Playwright available, run `node tests/upload-validation-smoke.cjs`
  from `src/frontend` (optional `CHROME_BIN` specifies an installed browser).
  Expected: UI smoke passes against mocked API responses. Backend API behavior
  is covered independently by pytest.

## Development launchers

- Action: Run `./src/start-demo.sh` or `src\start-demo.bat` and open `http://127.0.0.1:5174`.
  Expected: The preserved standalone mock demo loads without requiring a Flask process.
- Action: Run `./src/start-app.sh` or `src\start-app.bat` and open `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.
  Expected: The connected frontend loads, Flask is available at port 5000, and `/api/auth` requests reach Flask through Vite.
- Action: Stop each launcher with `Ctrl+C` on Unix or by closing its service window on Windows.
  Expected: The processes started by that launcher stop and the ports are released.
